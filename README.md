## Add the Inventory and Sales Reports links that are accessible only to the Store Manager
##### Under the Inventory link, the store manager shall be able to:

1. Generate a table of all products and how many items of every product currently available in the store; list only product name, price, how many items of that product available
2. Generate a Bar Chart that shows the product names and the total number of items available for every product
3. Generate a table of all products currently on sale
4. Generate a table of all products currently that have manufacturer rebates

##### Under the Sales Report link, the store manager shall be able to:

1. Generate a table of all products sold and how many items of every product sold; list only product name, product price, number of items sold, and total sales of every product sold
2. Generate a Bar Chart that shows the product names and the total sales for every product
3. Generate a table of total daily sales transactions; that is, you list the dates and total sales for every day-date

## To add the Search Auto-Completion feature.

### Required Functionalities:
1. See below an illustration for a screen-shot of BestBuy web site for the Search Auto-Completion feature
2. Your auto-complete-feature must be implemented as follows: When the app-server starts up, the Products are first read into a hashmap from ProductCatalog.xml file and then stored in MySQL database; follow this sequence.
3. Since a store manager can insert/update/delete products, all of these operations must be reflected in the hashmap and then MySQL database
4. All new code added for the auto-complete-complete feature shall be placed in a class called AjaxUtility.java

## to add two the following two features:
### Deal Match Guarantees feature
### Recommender feature

#### Required Functionalities for Deal Match Guarantees Feature:
See below an illustration for a screen-shot of SmartPortables web site for the required Deal Match feature

* Use the python script provided to create the DealMatches.txt File
* The python script will connect to Twitter server in order to get the current deals of BestBuy under the screen_name BestBuy_Deals

* The python script will connect to MySQL server for SmartPortables app in order to get the list of products
* The python script will compare the product names retrieved from MySQL server to the products names retrieved from screen_name BestBuy_Deals on Twitter server and it will write the tweets that have the products names that match the product names retrieved from MySQL server in the product table into DealMatches.txt file.

* When SmartPortables app is started by Tomcat server, it will read ANY 2 Tweets/lines from DealMatches.txt file and display them on SmartPortables app homepage along with links to the individual products that SmartPortables app can match of the offered/displayed deals by BestBuy on the homepage of SmartPortables app.

* All new code added for this feature shall be placed in a class called DealMacthes.java



### Our Approach to Implementing Recommender Systems :
For this Tutorial implementation , we have used Matrix Factorization technique for implementation which will be using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm already implemented in the Surprise package.
* Python Version : 3.6
* Anaconda Version : 4.2 ( higher versions should be ok)


#### Matrix Factorization : The Basics
###### Consider below matrix of users as rows and items as columns.What matrix factorization does is to come up with two smaller matrices, one representing users and one representing items, which when multiplied together will roughly produce matrix of ratings, ignoring the 0 entries.

###### Let our matrix be mxn, where m is the number of users and n is the number of items.So, we need mxd and a dxn matrix as our factors, where d is chosen to be small enough for the computation to be efficient and large enough to represent the number of dimensions along which interactions between users and items are likely to vary in some significant way.If we choose d=2, the predicted rating given by a user for a given item is then the dot product of the vector representing the user and the vector representing the item.We also need to add the bias for item i, user u and overall average rating for predicting the rating.

###### Theoretically, the predicted rating is given by below formula :
Ref : http://katbailey.github.io/post/matrix-factorization-with-tensorflow/
###### Where, Î¼ is the overall average rating, bi is the bias for item i, bu u, and is the interaction between item i and user u.
Ref : http://katbailey.github.io/post/matrix-factorization-with-tensorflow/


###### Matrix-factorization : API docsThe following class implements Matrix-factorization based prediction algorithms:
class surprise.prediction_algorithms.matrix_factorization.SVD 
###### The abstract class that defines the behavior of a prediction algorithm :
class surprise.prediction_algorithms.algo_base.AlgoBase

##### The famous SVD algorithm, as popularized by Simon Funk during the Netflix Prize uses it.
